I'm paid to be some kind of, "Software Developer".

An aspiring infosec practitioner, hobbyist hacker and a perpetual learner, I own a subpar
[website](https://www.wulfgar.pro), underutilised [twitter](https://twitter.com/wulfgarpro) account and an
empty [github](https://www.github.com/wulfgarpro).

This is my space, namely to record things I think I should record for my own prosperity.
