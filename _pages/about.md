A paid (some kind of) software developer, an aspiring infosec practitioner, a hobbiest hacker and a perpetual
learner. I own a subpar [website](https://www.wulfgar.pro), underutilised [twiiter](https://twitter.com/wulfgarpro) account and an empty [github](https://www.github.com/wulfgarpro).

This is my space, namely to record things I think I should record for my own prosperity.
