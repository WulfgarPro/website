upstream

	- slick front-end using native html/css (personal website in my case) - divs!
		- typography should be x-browser/x-platform

	- login for application access (might have to host on Google's app-engine)
		- jquery/HTML/css front-end
			- display subset of entries on successful login - have show more facility
			- nice error pages for service down (wulfgar-server down)
				- REST service(jaxrs) running on wulfgar-server
					- POST new entry
					- GET entry
					- use tagging system for commonality of entries
					- mongodb backend with single collection for entries
		- DSL for accentuation of terms in chron's
