Samsung's ROM flashing tool [Odin](http://odindownload.com/ "Odin") runs only on Windows.  There is a Linux tool named [Heimdall](http://glassechidna.com.au/heimdall/ "Heimdall") with the same intention as Odin, but it's not Samsung's official tool.  With Ubuntu as my host operating system, I was able to run Odin from a Windows 7 guest using VirtualBox.  

* Prerequisites:
** VirtualBox installed and guest Windows 7 VM running
** Odin downloaded and running on guest Windows 7 VM
**  

1. Install
