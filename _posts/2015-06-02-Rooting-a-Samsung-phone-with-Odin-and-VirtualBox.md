Samsung's ROM flashing tool [Odin](http://odindownload.com/ "Odin") runs only on Windows.  There is a Linux tool named [Heimdall](http://glassechidna.com.au/heimdall/ "Heimdall") with the same intention as Odin, but it's not Samsung's official tool.  With Ubuntu as the host operating system, I was able to run Odin from a Windows 7 guest using VirtualBox.
